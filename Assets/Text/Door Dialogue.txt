Holy crap, you solved it.
I mean...
You have done well, young player!
(feel free to be flattered if you're over the age of 29).
Your next trial will not be so easy! Now you must make a choice.
Behind one of these doors lies the path to victory.
Behind the other?
ETERNAL DAMNATION!!!
It's actually... kinda scary when you think about it.
So you'd better choose wisely, you old koot!
(now everyone above age 29 feels included).
Now begone!!!
...
Ok, ok, fine!
You wante ME to begone...
So rude...
