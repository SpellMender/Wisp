Who dares disturb my solitude!!!
Oh, it's just you.
Well, since you're here I may as well tell you how things work around here.
This world will give you trials. The first trial will help you with the next.
Who am I, you ask?
How dare you ask me, an all-powerful being of immense power, such a presumptuous question!
...
You can call me Steve for now. Pleased to meet you.
...
Should you prove yourself worthy, I will reveal unto you my TRUE name!!!
Only then will you be worthy to brag to your friends that you solved this obscure game on the fringes of cyberspace!
Now begone!!!
...
...oh, you're still here.
Ok, follow the wisps.
